Compiler (javac v7)
==================

This is a repackaged version of the Java compiler (javac) from OpenJDK 7.

It is repackaged to allow usage without conflicting with system installed libraries, and designed primarily
as an alternative compiler to use with the [Janino](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JANINO/Home) common compiler API.
